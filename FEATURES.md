# Project Features & Capabilities

This document outlines the key features and technical capabilities of the ForkMyFolio application, encompassing both the backend API and the frontend client.

## üèõÔ∏è Platform & Architecture

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Java 21, Spring Boot 3, and a Vue 3 frontend for a robust and high-performance application.
- **RESTful API**: A clean, well-structured API serves all data to the frontend, with clear endpoints under the `/api/v1/` path.
- **JPA/Hibernate ORM**: Manages all database interactions, mapping Java objects to MySQL database tables.
- **Centralized Exception Handling**: A global exception handler provides consistent and well-formatted error responses to the client.
- **Dockerized for Deployment**: The entire stack (backend, frontend, database) is containerized and orchestrated with Docker Compose for simple, one-command deployment.

## üîê Security

- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Secures the application using stateless JSON Web Tokens.
- **Secure Refresh Token Strategy**: Implements `HttpOnly` cookies for refresh tokens, protecting them from client-side script access and mitigating XSS risks.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Clear distinction between public `permitAll()` endpoints and protected `/admin/**` routes, which require admin privileges.
- **Password Encryption**: All user passwords are securely hashed using Spring Security's standard `BCryptPasswordEncoder`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Application Settings

A core architectural feature is the robust and flexible settings system, which allows for live configuration of the application without redeployment.

- **Unified API**: Both the public (`/api/v1/settings`) and admin (`/api/v1/admin/settings`) endpoints now provide a consistent, rich list of setting objects (`SettingDto`). This simplifies frontend logic and ensures data consistency.
- **Flexible Configuration**: The system supports not just boolean toggles (e.g., `SHOW_PROJECTS: "true"`) but also string-based values.
- **Dynamic PDF Templates**: A key example is the `DEFAULT_PDF_TEMPLATE` setting, which allows the admin to choose which PDF design (e.g., "modern", "classic", or a compact "one-page-resume") is used for public downloads.
- **Transactional Updates**: The admin `PUT` endpoint performs efficient, transactional bulk updates, ensuring data integrity.

## üìä Visitor Analytics & Tracking

- **Non-Intrusive Tracking**: Visitor metrics are captured using a system that keeps tracking logic completely separate from core business logic.
- **Admin Activity Isolation**: The system accurately distinguishes between public visitors and the logged-in admin, ensuring administrative actions do not inflate public engagement metrics.
- **Comprehensive Event Tracking**:
  - **Page/Section Views**: Tracks views for the main profile, projects list, skills, experience, qualifications, and testimonials sections.
  - **Engagement Events**: Monitors contact form submissions and PDF resume downloads.
  - **Individual Project Views**: Tracks views for each specific project by its UUID.
- **Authentication Event Monitoring**:
  - Automatically logs successful and failed login attempts for security auditing.

## üñ•Ô∏è Content Management System (Admin Panel)

A central dashboard provides access to all management functions:

-   **Full Content Management (CRUD)**: Provides complete admin interfaces for managing all portfolio content:
  -   **Profile**: Edit the public-facing homepage content, including headline, summary, and social links.
  -   **Projects**: Create, read, update, and delete projects, including image uploads and tech stack.
  -   **Skills**: Manage the list of skills and their proficiency levels.
  -   **Experience**: Add and edit work history in a timeline format.
  -   **Qualifications**: Maintain a list of degrees and certifications.
  -   **Testimonials**: Curate quotes and recommendations from colleagues and clients.
-   **Visitor Analytics Dashboard**: A dedicated page to view detailed statistics on site engagement, page views, and authentication events.
-   **Contact Message Inbox**: A simple interface to view and manage messages submitted through the public contact form.
-   **Live Site Configuration**:
  -   **Visibility Settings**: Instantly toggle the visibility of public portfolio sections (e.g., hide the 'Skills' page).
  -   **PDF Settings**: Select the default PDF template (e.g., "modern", "one-page-resume") for the public download button.
-   **Account Management**: Update private admin account details like name and email.
-   **Backup & Restore**: A powerful utility to download a full JSON backup of all portfolio data and restore it from a file, ensuring data safety and portability.

## ‚ú® User Experience (Vue.js Frontend)

- **Single-Page Application (SPA)**: A modern, reactive, and fast user interface built with Vue 3 and Vite.
- **Dynamic Content**: All content displayed on the public portfolio is fetched dynamically from the backend API. Sections are shown or hidden based on the live application settings.
- **Seamless Navigation**: Uses Vue Router for a smooth user experience without full page reloads.
- **Dynamic PDF Resume Generation**: Allows visitors to download a PDF version of the portfolio. The design of the generated PDF‚Äîwhether a full multi-page portfolio or a concise one-page resume‚Äîis determined by the `DEFAULT_PDF_TEMPLATE` setting controlled by the admin.
- **Secure Admin Dashboard**: A protected section of the application with a clean, intuitive interface for all content management and analytics viewing.
